# aframe-stereo-material

Use stereoscopic images or videos as material for your aframe objects.

### What does this component?

My goal with this component is to to add the ability to use stereoscopic materials (videos and images) in
a simple way with aframe. This is my first try, i used in a private projekt. An Example video, renderd on a
cylinder entity can be seen in the example directory.

For further information you can visit the repository from oscarmarinmiro. The main code is from his component,
i use it as basic component to extend it for my needs :)
