# aframe-stereo-material

use stereoscopic images or videos as material for your aframe objects

### code adopted from aframe-stereo-component

My goal with this component is to to add the ability to use stereoscopic materials (videos and images) in
a simple way. This is my first try for a private projekt. An Example video, renderd on a cylinder can be seen
here.

For further information you can visit the repository from oscarmarinmiro. The main code is from his component,
i use it as basic component to extend it for my needs :)
